This project is a Python based point-of-sale and menu management system designed to emulate a small coffeeshop/bookshop business. This was created using Visual Studio Code and version-controlled with GitHub to be collaborative and to track its development. 
It's main features include a menu management system allowing to easily add or remove items depending on stock, order processing, returns or refunds and employee functions. 
JSON's were used for data storage (stock, employee details and customer details) making it lightweight and portable and a CLI was used for quick input and output.
